# Kata Containers detection configuration
# Additional node label to check when detecting Kata Containers support. If specified, the labeler
# will check BOTH this custom label AND the default 'katacontainers.io/kata-runtime' label as
# input sources for detection. The labeler will then set the output label 
# 'nvsentinel.dgxc.nvidia.com/kata.enabled' to "true" or "false" based on the detection result.
# Example: 'custom.kata.label' or 'io.katacontainers.config.runtime.oci_runtime'
# Note: The input label value must be truthy (case-insensitive): "true", "enabled", "1", or "yes"
